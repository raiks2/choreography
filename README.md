# choreography

A super simple graph library. Contains classes implementing undirected and directed graphs Graphs support addEdge(), addVertex()
and findPath() operations. There's also a weighted graph implementation that adds support for weighted edges. In the future
it can be extended to support operations like findShortestPath() using Dijkstra's or A* algorithms.
